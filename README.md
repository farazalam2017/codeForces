### 📚 Key Terminologies

| Term                        | Meaning                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Problemset**              | Archive of problems filterable by tags, difficulty, or contest.                        |
| **Contest**                 | Timed competition with multiple problems to solve.                                     |
| **Divisions (Div)**         | Contest categories based on user rating: Div.1 (Pro), Div.2 (Mid), Div.3/4 (Beginner). |
| **Rating**                  | Numerical measure of user skill, updated after rated contests.                         |
| **Tags**                    | Concepts like `greedy`, `dp`, `math` used for problem classification.                  |
| **AC**                      | Accepted – correct solution.                                                           |
| **WA**                      | Wrong Answer – solution failed a test case.                                            |
| **TLE**                     | Time Limit Exceeded – solution took too long to run.                                   |
| **MLE**                     | Memory Limit Exceeded – solution used too much memory.                                 |
| **RE**                      | Runtime Error – solution crashed during execution.                                     |
| **Pretests / System Tests** | Pretests run during the contest; system tests finalize the result post-contest.        |

### 🧩 Problem Difficulty & Tags

Each problem includes:

- A title (e.g., `A. Elephant`)
- A difficulty rating (e.g., 800, 1200, 1900)
- Tags describing the concept required

| Tag              | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `greedy`         | Choose the best option at each step.               |
| `dp`             | Solve using overlapping subproblems.               |
| `math`           | Math-based logic and formulas.                     |
| `binary search`  | Optimize using search space division.              |
