- If there are three numbers a, b, c given then we have to sort them without any external sort functions.
- if(a>b) swap(a, b);
  if(a>c) swap(a, c);
  if(b>c) swap(b, c)
- Explanations:- Within three numbers a, b, c, (a>b) and (a>c) will sort the first element and make it smaller then now when b>c is done it sort b, place it at proper place, and at last c automatically at proper place.
